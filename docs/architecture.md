# Task Manager Frontend Architecture

## Overview
This is a modern task management application built with Vue.js 3, TypeScript, and a comprehensive set of modern web technologies. The application follows a component-based architecture with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and user experience.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Vue.js 3**: Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development
- **Pinia**: State management solution for Vue.js
- **Vue Router**: Official router for Vue.js

### UI/UX
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Material-UI (@mui/material)**: React component library for consistent design
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library
- **Heroicons**: SVG icon set
- **Roboto Font**: Primary typeface

### Development Tools
- **ESLint**: Code linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Vitest**: Unit testing framework
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing
- **Sass**: CSS preprocessor

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Architecture
- The application follows Vue.js's component-based architecture
- Components are organized by feature and reusability
- Smart components (views) are separated from presentational components

### State Management
- Uses Pinia for centralized state management
- Stores are organized by domain/feature
- Implements Vue's Composition API for better code organization

### Routing
- Implements Vue Router for SPA navigation
- Route-based code splitting for better performance
- Permission-based route guards

### API Integration
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Centralized API service layer
- Type-safe API integration with TypeScript

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Material-UI components for consistent design
- Responsive design patterns

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Unit testing with Vitest

### Build Process
- Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- PostCSS for CSS processing
- Asset optimization and bundling

### Development Scripts
- `yarn dev`: Start development server
- `yarn build`: Build for production
- `yarn test:unit`: Run unit tests
- `yarn lint`: Run linting
- `yarn format`: Format code

## Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Environment variable management
- Secure API communication

## Performance Considerations
- Route-based code splitting
- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized asset loading
- Efficient state management

## Future Considerations
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support
- Enhanced offline capabilities
- Real-time updates
- Advanced caching strategies
